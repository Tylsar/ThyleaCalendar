# ThyleaCalendar
Calendar script for Roll20 Thylea campaign

Instructions:
Create a new Script in your campaign and copy the code from the ThyleaCalendar.js into it.

Commands in Roll20:
!cal (as Player or GM to show the Calendar)
!calSet (To get to the config menu s GM)

This script has not been written by me. I merely adopted it for the Thylea Calendar. Credit is in the script.
